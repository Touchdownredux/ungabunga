  <p class="text">Hello Ms. Dunn! This is a website I quickly made off to the side as an introduction for stuff I can't put on slides. My name is James and I use He/Him, My skills include basic coding and drawing, I also consider myself to be a pretty good writer as long as I have the motivation to write. I also have my sets of Interests in games such as the Metal Gear series and the Borderlands series. My Favorite music artists are KGLW, Jamiroquai, and System Of A Down. If I had to recommend one song from each artist, I would say Perihelion, Virtual Insanity, and Innervision. More stuff to note is that I likely (if possible) will be writing about stuff from my interests, maybe about its story or a dive into the dynamics of a specific character, the message of the game if it has one, As long as I have an idea and motivation for the writing, I can easily write out everything gracefully and swiftly. I look forward to what I'll be learning in this class! </p>
